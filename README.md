### Purpose of the project

**The purpose of this project is to implement PCA analysis, Kmeans clustering, and ESG score data to allow users to choose a portfolio with high ESG rated assets that has similar risk/return metrics as either an existing portfolio, individual stocks or a portfolio of their choosing.  This is achieved by initially clustering stocks within major indices with similar profiles using PCA and Kmeans, and then analyzing the stocks within these clusters ESG characteristics allowing the user to adjust the portfolio based on their individual risk/return appetites and their value system related to Environmental, Social, and Governance metrics.  We will then utilize Monte Carlo simulations to project what the updated portfolios theoretical returns would be to give the user a sense of how they could construct a porftfolio that could be just as profitable / risky as a current one but with higher values associated with them.  We will also work to include assets such as cryptocurrency, bonds, gold, etc. within these clusters and profitability projections to allow for more diversification within the portfolio to see how that would affect risk and returns.**
